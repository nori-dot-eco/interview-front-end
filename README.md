## The Problem

Nori is creating a frontend website to gather information about carbon removals on the blockchain supplemented with data Nori has in its own datastores. You have been tasked with creating a page that provides an overview of the data, a simple filter, and detail information.

### Part 1: Get the data

Retrieve the data and display it in a list format on the page.

### Part 2: Display the details

Allow a user to click a row and see detailed information about the row
### Part 3: Filter the data

Create one or more filters on the data
